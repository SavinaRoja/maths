      "Many methods for these problems involve a *step size*, $h$. For each $h$ there is an approximation $^{1}$$\\widehat{A}(h) \\approx A$. We say that $\\widehat{A}$ is *consistent* if $\\widehat{A}(h) \\rightarrow A$ as $h \\rightarrow 0$. For example, we might estimate $A = f^{\\prime}(x)$ using the finite difference formula (3.14a): $\\widehat{A}(h) = (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h$. This is consistent, as $\\text{lim}_{h \\rightarrow 0}\\widehat{A}(h)$ is the definition of $f^{\\prime}(x)$. The accuracy of the approximation depends on $f$, but the *order of accuracy* does not.$^{2}$ The approximation is *first order accurate* if the error is nearly proportional to $h$ for small enought $h$. It is *second order* if the error goes like $h^{2}$ When $h$ is small, $h^{2} << h$, so approximations with a higher order of accuracy can be much more accurate."

In most practical computations that have truncation error, including numerical solution of differential equations or integral equations, the truncation error is much larger than roundoff. Referring to Figure 2.3, the practical range of $h$ from $.01$ to $10^{\u22125}$ , the computed error is roughly $4.1 \\cdot h$, as (3.4) suggests is should be. This starts to break down for the impractically small $h = 10^{\u22128}$. More sophisticated high order approximations reach roundoff sooner, which can be an issue in code testing, but rarely in large scale production runs."
